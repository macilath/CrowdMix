## Where Turkers Mix Things Up

Our project is an experimentation into the musical knowledge and preferences of a crowd of workers. This project, given a set of musical tracks as input, will rely on turkers to produce a new song by piecing together snippets from the input tracks.


Built on Python 2.7.6

This project requires the following libraries:
+ [boto](https://github.com/boto/boto)
+ [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/)
